# Algorithm Daily Challenge

Welcome to my Algorithm Daily Challenge repository! ðŸš€

In this repository, I aim to solve one problem every day and post my solutions here. Each solution will include code and an explanation of my approach. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms, and build a strong habit of continuous learning.

## Structure of the Repository

- **Solutions**: Each solution will be in its own folder named after the problem, following the format `Problem-Number_Problem-Name`. For example, for the Two Sum problem, the folder will be named `001_Two-Sum`.
- **Languages**: I'll mainly be solving problems in C#, but might experiment with others occasionally.
- **Explanation**: Each solution will include a `README.md` file explaining the approach, time complexity, and edge cases handled in the solution.

## Example Folder Structure

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ 001_Two-Sum
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.cs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 002_Add-Two-Numbers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution.cs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## TODO
- [ ] Add a testing layer with test cases and time execution comparison between solutions.
